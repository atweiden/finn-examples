blurb

hello, from inside /share/blurb

--- aisle two*
The relative file paths `starts-with-letter-a.txt` and `depth/charges.dat`
in the Includes below should be built relative to
`'/share/blurb'.IO.dirname` (which is /share) when this Sectional Block
is requested with a `§` Include. These should be the files:

- /share/starts-with-letter-a.txt
- /share/depth/charges.dat

The `§` Include handling recurses the Finn source Document directory
tree while updating the current file path with the file path of the
Document being processed. This file path update happens by instantiating
Finn::Parser::Actions with a `$.file` attribute. `$.file` is later
used to `IO.resolve` relative file paths to the proper absolute path
on disk with

    ($*file.IO.dirname ~ '/' ~ $include-request-file-path).IO.resolve

This is how include directives are handled in class
`TXN::Parser::Actions`.

¶ starts-with-letter-a.txt
§ '[zero]' depth/charges.dat
first time asking: what does this do to the parser?
